# Project: Investigate a Dataset - No show appointments

This was the first project in Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, I analyzed Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset and communicated my findings about it using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. 

## Dataset Description
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
